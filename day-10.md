### Knapsack problem

- You’re a thief with a knapsack that can carry a certain weight of goods, your task is to steal goods that fit in the knapsack such that the value stolen is maximum
- For this problem the dynamic programming approach is to start by solving the problem for smaller knapsacks and then work up to solvinng the original problem
- `Dynamic programming` starts by solving  subproblems and builds up to solving the big problem.

- Dynamic programming is useful when we trying to optimize something given a constraint.
- Dynamic programming can be used when the problem can be broken down into discrete problems
- Every dynamic programming problem involves a grid.
- The values in the grid are usually what we are trying to optimize
- As each cell is a subproblem, we must think about how we can divide the problem into smaller subproblems
- There isn’t a single formula for calculating a dynamic programming solution
